This project will demonstrate basic HTML knowledge such as creating title and heading tags. Moreover, this project will also demonstrate the skills needed in creating both ordered and unordered lists. Similarly, adding imgages that link to outside webpages using anchor tags and displaying images using img src attributes will also be demonstrated throughout the course of this project.
